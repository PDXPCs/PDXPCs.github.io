            <p class="p-body">The removal of the Elwha and Glines Canyon dams on the Elwha River has not only resulted
                in astounding changes to the environment, it has also provided great opportunities for scientists to better understand
                how the ecosystem functions. Researchers have studied delta erosion and development and how fish, mammals,
                invertebrates, and birds respond to a return to more natural processes. And, in new data, they are seeing what can happen with
                the removal of shoreline armoring. “It's like watching a highlight reel, sped up,” says Jamie Michel, a nearshore biologist 
                with the Coastal Watershed Institute.
